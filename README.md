# 9gag-delete-nsfw
This greasemonkey script will automatically delete any posts marked as NSFW.

## Install
You must have Greasemonkey installed on Firefox. If you use Google Chrome, Tampermonkey will work.

[Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StakeSagaQuo/9gag-delete-nsfw/master/9gag_nsfw_delete.user.js) to install the script.

It will automatically update if there are updates available.

## Purpose
9gag, by default, hides posts that their users submit as NSFW. It shows a black banner instead of the post, requiring the user to login and allow NSFW posts.

If you are already logged in, clicking on the NSFW overlay will automatically change your setting to allow NSFW posts.

Some of us want to browse 9gag with less temptation, where a simple click will show us a NSFW post. This Userscript completely removes these posts. It also deletes the NSFW link in the header.

## Warning
Many posts on 9gag are not marked as NSFW by the submitter. This script is not an artificial intelligence, and it cannot remove any offensive posts that are not marked with 9gag's built-in NSFW flag.
